Benchmark performance:
- As mentioned in the abstract, the values of the metrics of interest - accuracy, precision, recall and Dice similarity coefficient - reached remarkable values, comparable to those obtained in other studies of the same type. The developed model achieved a remarkable accuracy value of 96.65% for the classification of images from the test data set, and in addition the Dice similarity coefficient recorded values of up to 89.428% in tumor segmentation.
- Considering that the proposed model is unique for the addressed competition, the evaluation of the benchmark performance will be based on similar studies of the same king mentioned in the report.

Ablation Study:
- The study components are organized in the following sections: in section II are described the related works; in section III the proposed approach to solve the problem is described step by step. In section IV is presented the ablation study. Section V exposes the discussion based on the project. Last but not least, within section VI is stated the conclusion.
- For this competition no other scores were recorded.
- The entire list of findings is specified in the report, but the most important aspect that must be mentioned is the use of the gpu board to reduce the network training time.
